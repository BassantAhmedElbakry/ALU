# ALU
ALU is the fundamental building block of the processor,  which is responsible for carrying out different functions:
<br>- Arithmetic functions through ARITHMETIC_UNIT block.
<br>- Logic functions through LOGIC_UNIT block.
<br>- Shift functions through SHIFT _UNIT block.
<br>- Comparison functions through CMP_UNIT block. 
<br>And Decoder Unit responsibles for enable which Function to operate according to the highest Most significant 2-bit of the ALU_FUNC control bus ALU_FUNC [3:2].
<br>Test bench to test all the ALU functions with operating clock frequency 100 KHz with duty cycle 40% low and 60% high.
